### **Project Evaluation Rubric: Advanced Customer Service AI**

This rubric is designed to evaluate the project based on the criteria outlined in the official project specification. Each category will be scored on a scale from Unsatisfactory to Exemplary.

**Scoring Scale:**
*   **Exemplary (4 points):** Exceeds all requirements for the criterion. The implementation is robust, clean, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the concepts.
*   **Proficient (3 points):** Meets all requirements for the criterion. The implementation is functional and correct.
*   **Developing (2 points):** Partially meets the requirements for the criterion. The implementation may be incomplete or contain significant errors.
*   **Unsatisfactory (1 point):** Fails to meet the core requirements for the criterion. The feature is missing or non-functional.

| Category | Criterion | Exemplary (4 pts) | Proficient (3 pts) | Developing (2 pts) | Unsatisfactory (1 pt) | Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend Implementation (30%)** | **1. Multi-Agent System** | Implements a robust, stateful multi-agent workflow using LangGraph with a clear orchestrator-worker hierarchy. State management is effective and the code is highly modular. [1] | Implements a functional multi-agent workflow using LangGraph as specified. The system correctly routes tasks and manages state. | Attempts a multi-agent system, but there are significant issues with routing or state management. The implementation may not use LangGraph correctly. | A single agent is used, or the multi-agent implementation is non-functional. | |
| | **2. Specialized Worker Agents** | All three worker agents (Billing, Technical, Policy) are implemented with distinct, correct logic that perfectly aligns with their specified roles. | At least two of the three specified worker agents are implemented correctly. The third may be missing or have flawed logic. | Only one worker agent is implemented, or the agents lack clear specialization and differentiation in their logic. | No functional, specialized worker agents are implemented as required. | |
| | **3. FastAPI API Endpoint** | A clean, well-defined `/chat` endpoint is created using FastAPI best practices (Pydantic models, async). Response streaming is implemented effectively for a real-time user experience. [2, 3] | A functional `/chat` endpoint exists and correctly interfaces with the agentic core. It may lack streaming or advanced features like Pydantic validation. | The API endpoint is present but has significant bugs, does not connect properly to the agent core, or is not implemented with FastAPI. | The API is missing or non-functional. | |
| **Frontend Implementation (20%)** | **4. User Interface & Experience** | The Next.js chat interface is polished, fully responsive, and highly intuitive. Components are well-structured, reusable, and provide an excellent user experience. [4] | The chat interface is functional and meets all MVP requirements (displays history, accepts input). It may lack visual polish or advanced responsiveness. | The UI is partially functional but has significant layout issues, is not intuitive, or is missing key components like the message history display. | The frontend is missing, non-functional, or does not provide a basic chat interface. | |
| | **5. API Integration & Streaming** | The frontend seamlessly communicates with the backend API, correctly handling the streaming response to display the AI's answer token-by-token in real-time. | The frontend communicates with the backend but does not implement streaming (i.e., it waits for the full response before displaying it). | API communication is unreliable, with frequent errors, or the response data is not handled correctly on the frontend. | No successful communication is established between the frontend and the backend. | |
| **System Architecture & Integration (20%)** | **6. Adherence to Tech Stack** | The project correctly and effectively uses all specified technologies: Python, FastAPI, LangChain, LangGraph, ChromaDB, Next.js, OpenAI, and AWS Bedrock. | The project uses most of the specified technologies but substitutes one or two minor components or fails to use one of the required LLM providers. | The project deviates significantly from the specified tech stack, failing to use multiple core components as required. | The project does not use the core required technologies (e.g., LangChain, a vector DB, a Python backend). | |
| | **7. Multi-Provider LLM Strategy** | Successfully implements the strategic multi-LLM strategy, using a cost-effective model (AWS Bedrock) for the routing task and a powerful model (OpenAI) for response generation. [5, 6] | Uses both OpenAI and AWS Bedrock models but does not apply them strategically as specified (e.g., uses the powerful model for the simple routing task). | Attempts to use multiple LLM providers, but the implementation is buggy, or only one model is ever successfully called. | Only a single LLM provider is used throughout the application. | |
| **Data & Retrieval Strategy (20%)** | **8. Data Ingestion Pipeline** | A robust, automated script correctly loads, chunks, embeds, and stores all mock data with appropriate metadata into a persistent ChromaDB instance. [7, 8] | The ingestion pipeline is functional but may be manual, lack metadata for filtering, or use a non-persistent in-memory database. | The data ingestion process is incomplete or has significant errors that prevent the knowledge base from being populated correctly. | No data is successfully ingested into the vector store, leaving the agents without a knowledge base. | |
| | **9. Implementation of Retrieval Strategies** | Correctly implements and clearly demonstrates all three specified retrieval strategies: Pure RAG (Technical Support), Pure CAG (Policy), and Hybrid RAG/CAG (Billing). | Correctly implements and demonstrates at least two of the three required retrieval strategies. The third may be missing or implemented incorrectly. | Implements a single, generic RAG strategy for all agents, failing to demonstrate an understanding of CAG or Hybrid models. | The retrieval mechanism is not implemented or is non-functional across all agents. | |
| **Project Submission & Documentation (10%)** | **10. GitHub & README** | The public GitHub repository is well-organized and contains a comprehensive `README.md` with a project overview and clear, error-free setup and execution instructions. [9] | The repository is public, but the `README.md` is incomplete, contains errors, or the setup instructions are unclear. | The repository is public, but there is no `README.md` file to explain the project or how to run it. | The repository is private, empty, or missing entirely. | |
| | **11. Video Demonstration** | The unlisted YouTube video is clear, concise (5-10 mins), and effectively demonstrates the project's architecture, a live demo of all agents, and a code walkthrough. | The video is provided but is missing one of the required components (e.g., no code walkthrough) or is significantly outside the specified time limit. | The video only shows the application running, with no verbal explanation of the architecture or code. | The video demonstration is missing. | |
